		<p>BVS project is a vision system consist several programs cooperates each other.
		Created for transferring real to 3D digital world. The main aid of project is to show
		how many opportunities creates computer vision, image processing systems and techniques
		such as structure from motion</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h4>How it works</h4>

		<p>When you run mobile application, it init connection with remote server. Every time
		you take photo, it is automatically sent in background to server.When you click done
		button server call special program witch reconstruct photographed object.
		After reconstruction server send back model to mobile app and you will be able to
		interact and manipulate it.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h4>Origin</h4>

		<p>BVS project is continuation of work on the system for 3D reconstruction of exterior
		environment using optical measurement method. The first results has been published in my
		Engineer\'s Thesis "<em>Wykorzystanie geometrii do badania geometrii obiekt√≥w</em>".</p>
